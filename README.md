# ud036_StarterCode
Source code for a Movie Trailer website.

## Intro
This project contains source code that - when run - shows a page with
a couple of my favourite movies.

## Prerequisites
This code runs on Python version 3.*x*. Refer to [Python Setup and
Usage â€” Python 3.6.4
documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.6/using/index.html) on how to
setup Python on your computer.

## Running the software

* Make sure you have a `cmd` window opened (Windows), or a terminal
  application (any Unix-based system, including MacOS).
* Make sure you have the Python v3.*x* executable in your PATH, let's
assume it is called `python3`.
* Now simply type `python3 entertainment_center.py` to see the result.

If all goes well, you should see that your webbrowser displays a page
with some movie posters. You can click on the movie poster to see the
corresponding movie trailer.

## Adapting the software to your own needs
You are free to adapt a copy of this code to your own needs, e.g. to
specify your own favourite set of movies.

In order to do that,

* you can adapt the file `entertainment_center.py`.
* In function `main()`, the variable `movies` is built up to contain a
list of favourite movies (which are instances of class `Movie`).
* You can add/change this list in to specify your own specific list of
movies.

## License
`fresh_tomatoes.py` and this very `README.md` file are derived works
from [udacity/ud036_StarterCode: Starter

Since this is a practice project, contributing is not necessary, nor desired.
